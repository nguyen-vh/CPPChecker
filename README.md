# CPPChecker

CPPChecker is an automated C++ program designed to thoroughly examine provided C++ code for the presence of classes, functions, variables, and their corresponding data types, along with verifying the output. The main objective of CPPChecker is to validate the given code after ensuring its independent functionality, guaranteeing that it runs smoothly without encountering errors during the checking process. To achieve this robustness, the program leverages SFINAE (Substitution Failure Is Not An Error) techniques and hides certain elements within namespaces, effectively circumventing compiler errors that might occur when classes, functions, or other components are absent. The provided code should be placed inside a namespace named "STUDENT" for the program not to fail. Overall, CPPChecker serves as a powerful tool for code verification.

## Download

This program is designed to be **dependency-free**, meaning no third-party libraries are used. To use the code, include "**iostream**" and "**sstream**". If there's an error, include "type_traits". You can easily copy and paste the code since the program runs on its own.

### Setup

+ The program has been tested with **C++20** and **C++23** (August 2023)
+ For a better comments experience, consider downloading **"Better Comments"** by Aaron Bond (VS Code)
+ To add more color to the code, you can download **"Better C++ Syntax"** by Jeff Hykin (VS Code)

### Important

1. There's a Github Action in place that tests if "[CPPChecker.cpp](https://github.com/nguyen-vh/CPPChecker/tree/main/CPPChecker)" compiles. If it fails, **DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT!**
2. There is a **Unit Test** for "[cppchecker.hpp](https://github.com/nguyen-vh/CPPChecker/tree/main/CPPChecker/As_header)" and if the Github Action for this fails, **DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT!**
